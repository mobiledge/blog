# Grouping Subviews for Accessible Collection View Cells

In iOS development, UICollectionViewCell is commonly used for presenting content in a collection view. By default, the subviews of a UICollectionViewCell are treated as separate accessibility elements by VoiceOver. This can be problematic if the cell contains multiple subviews, such as a title label, subtitle label, and an image, which can be challenging to navigate for some users.

To address this issue, we can use the technique of treating the cell as a single element by setting the isAccessibilityElement property of the cell to true. We can also set the accessibilityLabel property of the cell to a combination of the titleLabel and subtitleLabel text.

To implement this technique, we can create a method, configureAccessibility(), within the UICollectionViewCell subclass. In this method, we can set the isAccessibilityElement property of the cell to true, disable the accessibility elements of its subviews, and set the accessibilityLabel property to a combination of the titleLabel and subtitleLabel text.

By using this technique, we can make our collection view cells more accessible for users with disabilities, providing a better user experience for all users.

```swift
class MyCollectionViewCell: UICollectionViewCell {
    @IBOutlet weak var titleLabel: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet weak var subtitleLabel: UILabel!

    func configureAccessibility() {
        titleLabel.isAccessibilityElement = false
        subtitleLabel.isAccessibilityElement = false
        isAccessibilityElement = true
        accessibilityLabel = "\(titleLabel.text ?? ""), \(subtitleLabel.text ?? "")"
    }

    // Other methods and properties
}
```
