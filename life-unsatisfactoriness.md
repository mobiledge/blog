# Unsatisfactoriness

Life is inherently unsatisfactory, regardless of our circumstances. Whether things are good or bad, this dissatisfaction remains constant. This idea connects with the simulation hypothesis: perhaps our world was designed to be this way. No matter how much effort we put in to perfect any aspect of our lives, there's always something missing. We can achieve 80%, but we never quite reach the final 20%.

For example, in my personal experience with physics, I've often felt that things don't quite make sense. Basic concepts like forces and energy seemed counterintuitive when expressed in mathematical terms. While studying these concepts in school, I struggled to grasp their true meaning. Despite my efforts, they never fully clicked for me. It's possible that I didn't spend enough time with them to make them click, but I often wished they did.

Similarly, in my relationships, no matter how much I value them and put in effort to nurture and maintain them, things never feel ideal. I can succeed in making others happy to some extent, but there's always something that prevents the relationship from being perfect. It's as if I can get close to an ideal, but never fully reach it.

This feeling of inherent unsatisfactoriness also ties into the concept in Buddhism, where it is expected and not out of the ordinary that life is this way. This perspective is interesting to me, as it suggests that this dissatisfaction is a fundamental part of our existence.
