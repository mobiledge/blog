# Unsatisfactoriness

Life is inherently unsatisfactory, regardless of our circumstances. Whether things are good or bad, this dissatisfaction remains constant. Perhaps our world was designed to be this way. 

In Buddhism, this is expected and not out of the ordinary that life is this way. This perspective is interesting to me, as it suggests that dissatisfaction is a fundamental part of our existence.
