# Neighbors are important

I've noticed we tend to value ideological proximity over physical proximity. That is, we think it's fine to _just_ hang out people whose ideological beliefs are similar to ours, while not valuing those who're right next to us but have a belief system different from ours. I think this is a mistake. Whether at the societal/political level, or at the level of individual households, getting along with your neighbors is more important than getting along with somebody far away. Time and again I've seen local differences being exploited by outside parties, making them worse off in the long run.

I think of it this way, if my house is on fire, who can help me before even the firefighters arrive? My next-door neighbor (with the political opinions I disagree with), or my like-minded friend across town? 

Make peace with your neighbors. They may have been unfair to you or not as helpful or supportive as you'd like, but at the end of the day, **imperfect neighbors are better than hostile neighbors**.
