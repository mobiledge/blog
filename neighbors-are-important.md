# Neighbors are important

We often value ideological proximity - thinking it's fine to just get along with people who are like us intellectually, and not value those who are different but located right next to us. This is a mistake, whether at the national political level or at the level of individual households. Getting along with your neighbors is more important than getting along with somebody far away, because there will come a time when your local differences will be exploited by outside parties, making you worse off in the long run.
