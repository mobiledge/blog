# Neighbors are important

We often value ideological proximity - thinking it's fine to just get along with people who are like us intellectually, and not value those who are different but located right next to us. This is a mistake, whether at the national political level or at the level of individual households. Getting along with your neighbors is more important than getting along with somebody far away, because there will come a time when your local differences will be exploited by outside parties, making you worse off in the long run.

I think the same goes for families.  If your house catches fire or any other emergency happens, who can reach you before even the firefighters arrive? Your next-door neighbor with the political opinions you disagree with with, or your like-minded friend across town? 

Make peace with your neighbors. They may have been unfair to you or not as helpful or supportive as you'd like, but at the end of the day, imperfect neighbors are better than hostile neighbors.
