# Neighbors are important

I've noticed we tend to value ideological proximity over physical proximity. Meaning, we think it's fine to _just_ hang out people whose ideological beliefs are similar to ours, while not valuing those who have a different belief system while located right next to us. I think this is a mistake, whether at the societal/political level or at the level of individual households. Getting along with your neighbors is more important than getting along with somebody far away, because there will come a time when your local differences will be exploited by outside parties, making you worse off in the long run.

I think of it this way, if my house is on fire, who can help you before even the firefighters arrive? Your next-door neighbor with the political opinions you disagree with with, or your like-minded friend across town? 

Make peace with your neighbors. They may have been unfair to you or not as helpful or supportive as you'd like, but at the end of the day, **imperfect neighbors are better than hostile neighbors**.
