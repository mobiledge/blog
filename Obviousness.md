# Obviousness

Writing bad code is easy, but writing good code is exponentially more difficult. The challenge isn't linear; it's a significant leap.

This frustrates me to no end but I find this difficult to verbalize. There's a phrase I've encountered recently that resonates with this idea: "It takes an enormous amount of energy to refute bullshit, more than it takes to create bullshit." This perfectly encapsulates the effort required to write quality code. Writing bad code is simple, but crafting code the right way is incredibly challenging.

Good code is understandable. It accurately models the domain. The big pieces must fit together well, and the intent is **obvious** at a higher and lower levels. Achieving "obviousness" in code hovever requires careful design. The genius lies in the simplicity, yet this simplicity often goes unrecognized. People often take this for granted. 

Its like with governent when buses run on time and streets are clean, it's easy to overlook the complexity behind it all. However, when things break down, we realize the intricacies involved in maintaining a functioning society. Interestingly, this skill isn't easily taught. Programmers who've been in the field for years, still struggle to grasp this. This is both fascinating and frustrating.
