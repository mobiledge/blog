# Simple is hard

Programmers often mistake complexity for cleverness. The truth is: writing complex code is easy. It takes real mastery to find the simple, obvious solution that makes everyone say 'of course!' That's the true mark of expertise. This is exponentially more difficult - it's a significant leap.

In code reviews, I find it incredibly frustrating how easy it is to defend complexity, yet how hard it is to argue for simplicity. There's a phrase I've encountered recently that resonates with this idea: "It takes an enormous amount of energy to refute bullshit, more than it takes to create bullshit." 

Good code is understandable. It accurately models the domain. The big pieces must fit together well, and the intent is **obvious** at a higher and lower levels. Achieving "obviousness" in code hovever requires genius. Yet this genius often goes unrecognized. People often take this for granted. 

Its like with governent when buses run on time and streets are clean, it's easy to overlook the complexity behind it all. However, when things break down, we realize the intricacies involved in maintaining a functioning society. Interestingly, this skill isn't easily taught. Programmers who've been in the field for years, still struggle to grasp this. This is both fascinating and frustrating.
